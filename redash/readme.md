# Using Redash with Aether.

 - Run `./setup.sh`
 - do `docker-compose up -d`
 - Goto `http://localhost:5000`
 - Create an Admin in the interface.
 - Goto sources and create a Postgres source.
   - Host: `db`
   - Port: `5432`
   - User: `readonlyuser`
   - Database Name: `aether`
 - Use the settings from the `../.env` file for the `readonlyuser` for postgres credentials.

 Every time you do a `docker-compose down`, you'll need to re-run setup to initialize the Redash database.
